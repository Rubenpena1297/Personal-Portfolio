# Personal-Portfolio
Welcome to my Analytics Portfolio, please feel free to scroll through and view anything you'd like!


I recently took up trying to learn SQL, and Python and ill be using this along my journey in creating it and hopefully will see some progress by the end of a few months!
Ill definitely keep all who visit my page updated on my journey and while I am sure there will be alot of mistake, thats what learning is for amiright!
I am mostly learning to build my skills to become a data analyst, im currently an auditor, but really see data analytics in my future!
